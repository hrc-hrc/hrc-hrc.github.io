Under that name, the d'Alyths played a key role in the Scottish Wars of Independence [11] However, Mark Elliot presents a well-argued case that there is no connection between the Elliot river and town with the clan and believes the origins are in the first name of Elwald, which appears in Northumberland in the 8th century king, Elwald 1. The name has Anglo-Saxon origins and appears alongside Armstrong in Northumbrian records dating from 1165. [12] The first chief is claimed to be Robert Elwold (1305-67), who came from York, but migrated to the area around Hermitage Castle [13] Robert Elwold of Redheuch is granted lands around Redheuch and Larriston in the 1484 Sasine deed [14] Robert, 13th clan chief, who was killed at the Battle of Flodden is recorded with the surname 'Elwold'.\n\nThe original Anglo-Saxon surnames from Northumbria like Aelwold, Ellwald, Elaund, Elwaird, Elwods, Alwods, Elyards, Halwads seem to have mixed together eventually as Ellot. Sir Arthur and the Dowager Lady Eliott maintained that the family were originally known as Ellots. Lady Elliot in:'The Elliots: The Story of a Border Clan' says: \"Around 1650 someone added an \"i\" to our name to make it Elliot, which was without a doubt unfortunate as it confuses the clan with a well-known English Norman family called Eliot who settled in West England\". That would exclude the idea that the Cornish Eliots set the clan up a few centuries earlier, but it is said that this was some means of expressing solidarity with John Eliot (statesman), who was regularly imprisoned by Charles I until his death in 1632.\n\nA Thomas Elyot is recorded in West Lothian, dying in 1505")])])])},function(){var t=this,e=t.$createElement,a=t._self._c||e;return a("footer",{staticClass:"b_footer"},[a("div",{staticClass:"b_wrap"},[a("div",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://telegram.org/",target:"_black"}},[a("img",{attrs:{src:"/static/image/telegram.png",alt:""}}),t._v(" "),a("p",[t._v("Telegram")])])]),t._v(" "),a("div",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://www.facebook.com/UsechainFoundation",target:"_black"}},[a("img",{attrs:{src:"/static/image/facebook.png",alt:""}}),t._v(" "),a("p",[t._v("Facebook")])])]),t._v(" "),a("div",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://twitter.com/usechain",target:"_black"}},[a("img",{attrs:{src:"/static/image/twitter.png",alt:""}}),t._v(" "),a("p",[t._v("Twitter")])])]),t._v(" "),a("div",[a("a",{attrs:{href:"https://github.com/",target:"_black"}},[a("img",{attrs:{src:"/static/image/git.png",alt:""}}),t._v(" "),a("p",[t._v("GitHub")])])])])])}]};var s=a("VU/8")({name:"blogone",data:function(){return{navlist:["Home","HRC","Scenes","Architecture","Blog"],navnum:4}},methods:{}},i,!1,function(t){a("hWBg")},null,null);e.default=s.exports},hWBg:function(t,e){}});
